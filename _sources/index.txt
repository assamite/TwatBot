Welcome to Twatbot's documentation!
===================================

TwatBot is a twitter bot built for a course "Computational foundations of linguistic creativity",
held in University of Helsinki, fall 2014.

TwatBot generates color names for color codes, e.g. ``0x081960``, based on the 
linguistic knowledge it has about different colors, and their relations. The project 
is developed as a Django app, so that its reasoning for giving certain names to 
certain color codes is easy to follow from a web site.
